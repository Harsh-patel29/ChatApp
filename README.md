# ChatApp â€” Real-time Chat Platform

A full-stack chat application with real-time messaging, user authentication, and scalable message persistence. The project includes a Next.js frontend and an Express + Prisma backend. It uses Redis for in-memory message buffering, Kafka for batching and reliably persisting messages, and Prisma with a Postgres-compatible database for storage. Authentication is powered by Better-Auth and supports email/password plus Google social sign-in.
